# Hello, I'm Peter 

I'm a poet-turned-coder building tools for manipulating language.

In Fall 2024 I attended [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). While I was there I worked on a variety of C++ projects for manipulating the sound of language:
- [**Phonetic**](https://github.com/peterchinman/phonetic/), for working with the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary
- [**Rhyme & Meter**](https://github.com/peterchinman/rhyme-and-meter), for checking rhyme & meter in custom poetic forms
- [**Vowel Deformer**](https://github.com/peterchinman/vowel-deformer), for manipulating vowel-space--like a color filter, but for words

I used WebAssembly to integrate these C++ projects into fully-functional web applications:
- [**Strictly**](https://github.com/peterchinman/strictly), a rhyme & meter checker
- [**lighght**](https://github.com/peterchinman/lighght), a silent letter detector


I like building for the web. I think WASM is exciting. I like designing interfaces. I think Figma is a beautiful tool. I feel as at home in C++ as I do in CSS.
